# Predictive Stock Analysis

Predictive Stock Analysis is a Python project that aims to predict future stock prices using historical stock data. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms, particularly LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks, to forecast stock prices based on past performance. By analyzing trends and patterns in the data, it provides insights that can assist investors in making informed decisions.

## Features

- **Flexible Input**: Users can provide the CSV files containing historical stock data, enabling analysis on a wide range of stocks.
- **Predictive Modeling**: The project employs LSTM networks, known for their ability to capture temporal dependencies in sequential data, making them suitable for predicting stock prices.
- **Visualization**: The results are visualized using matplotlib, offering clear representations of both actual and predicted stock prices.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/thesaibharath/TheStockPredictorSBX.git
```

3. Navigate to the repository directory:

```
cd TheStockPredictorSBX
```

4. Install the required Python packages:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Usage

1. Replace the sample CSV file with your historical stock data. Make sure the CSV file contains at least one column representing the stock's closing price.

2. Modify the Python script `stkp_main.py` to point to your CSV file:

```python
data = pd.read_csv("stock_data.csv")
```

3. Run the Python script:

```
python stkp_main.py
```

4. After running the script, the predicted stock prices will be displayed along with a visualization comparing the actual and predicted prices.
